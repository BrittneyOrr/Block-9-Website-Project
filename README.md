# Block-9-Website-Project

For this project, I had to create a website all about me. There were 3 main webpages I had to create:
index.html
about.html
portfolio.html

Within each website, I had to design the aesthetics of the site, colors, font, etc. 

I also had to include important information and pictures related to me and what I would like to show future tech employers. It is a work in progress, so everything is not quite filled in.

I needed to include a pop up in javascript saying "Hello World" on each website.
