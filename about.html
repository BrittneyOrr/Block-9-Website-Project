                    <p>I enjoy writing young adult fantasy novels. I have always loved reading fantasy novels growing up and the spark to create my own world cultivated throughout the years until I finally made a reality by publishing my first novel in June of 2022.</p>

<h2>Things I excel at</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Breaking down and planning a project</li>
        <p>I do very well at breaking a project into bite size pieces that are digestible in a fashion that makes completing a project less of headache when focusing on what exactly needs to be done.</p>
    <li>Finding resources</li>
        <p>I do very well at researching things and providing the information in a way that is accessible and easy to understand.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Experience</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Highschool Coding classes</li>
        <p>After all these years, I remember learning how to code a March Madness bracket using drop down boxes. Most fun I remember having in high school over 10 years ago.</p>
    <li>Fullstack Academy Bootcamp</li>
    <p>November 2023 - May 2024</p>
    <p>Fast-paced with a lot of content in a short amount of time. Very valuable course to develop my coding skills. </p>
